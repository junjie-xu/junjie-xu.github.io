Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I'm Junjie Xu, a second-year Ph.D. student in the College of [Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu) at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I'm co-advised by Prof. [Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/) and Prof. Xiang Zhang(https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/xzz89/). I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong [University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn) in 2021. My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Graph Neural Networks.
